## Approach

This dataset was found on Kaggle and contains the academic performance of students with several variables. These variables may or may not be correlated the students probability of success. 

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
#load in the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#variables use <- and not = in R (reminder). This is the RAW link, use quotes because it is a string
dataset_url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/desithomas/data_607_assignment_1/refs/heads/main/StudentPerformanceFactors.csv"


#Load the data. Create a variable and add the dataset_url to the read_csv function
student_data <- read_csv(dataset_url)

View(student_data)
```
